# Switch-Mode-Power-Supply

• Developed a model for a closed-loop forward converter and implemented with MOSFET drivers enabled by PWM.

• Appraised the stability of the closed-loop transfer function by modifying the type III controller with voltage Op-Amp.

• Maintained a stable 10 V DC output from a 44 V unregulated AC power supply and working up to full or low load.
